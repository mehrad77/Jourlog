I'm always starting new things. well since I'm only 20 years old it's not that odd. there is not much history in my life and many many many things I do, I'm trying for the first time. Like for example, I've never been outside of Iran border. First, because we needed money for more important things and now because the government wants me to pass my obligatory Military service! but nevermind :)) you're not here to read about this issue (yet!)

It's my first time that I'm writing in English. I never went to any English class and mostly learned this language by games and movies. so please tell me if there is any bold mistake in my writings. even if you're familiar with git, you can fix my mistakes and push to my blog git branch. I'd be thankful for sure.
