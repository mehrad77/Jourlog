These days I'm working on a new project in the workplace which is the first project I work on that is built on Prisma and Yoga. I worked with Prisma before on the days that the only way to access Prisma was [Prisma Bindings](https://www.prisma.io/features/bindings). but at this new project, we were using [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-client/).

Imagine this project we have here is a social media app with these models:

```
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  email: String! @unique
  password: String!
  username: String @unique
  fullName: String!
  role: [UserRole]!
  settings: UserSetting @relation(name: "UserSettings" link: INLINE)
  following: [User] @relation(name: "UserFollowings" link: INLINE)
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
}

```

As it's [mentioned here](https://www.prisma.io/forum/t/query-returns-null-when-query-to-the-prisma-server-works/7092) and [here](https://www.prisma.io/forum/t/how-to-write-nested-relation-connection-subfield-resolvers/3768), with Prisma Bindings we could use something like this for our queries to get all the nested queries we wanted:

```ts
// Prisma Bindings
me(parent, args, { prisma, request }, info) {
  const userId = getUserId(request)
  return prisma.query.user({
    where: {
      id: userId
    },
    info
  });
}

```

which by passing `info`, the Prisma query would notice what fields it must fetch from the database.

but when I was looking in my code, my Prisma query only had one parameter which was the filter/sort object. so I handled it this way:

```ts
// Prisma Client
 async user(_, __, ctx: IContext) {
    const user = await ctx.db.user({ id: ctx.user.id });
    // Getting userSettings because apparently `ctx.db.user` won't give it
    const [userSettings] = await ctx.db.userSettings({ where: { user: { id: ctx.user.id } } });
    return { ...user, settings: userSettings };
  },

```

But there is a problem, this method is ok on single queries but won't work on list queries:

```ts
  async users(_, __, ctx: IContext) {
    return await ctx.db.query.users();
  },

```

In my front-end, when I was using this `users` query, I wasn't getting for example `user.following` relational data.

the workaround for this is **`$fragment` API** explained in [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-client/basic-data-access/reading-data-JAVASCRIPT-rsc2/#selecting-fields):

> Instead of querying all scalar fields of a record (which is the default behavior), you can specify which fields you'd like to retrieve by using the \$fragment API. This is useful to exclude large unneeded fields (like BLOB values or huge strings). It also lets you fetch arbitrary relations.

so the code would be rewritten like this:

```ts
async users(_, __, ctx: IContext) {
  const fragment = `
    fragment UserWithFollowings on User {
      id
      fullName
      email
      following {
        id
        email
      }
    }
  `;
  return await ctx.db.query.users().$fragment(fragment);
},

```

The docs is saying there will be a _next version of the Prisma client API that has an improved and type-safe API to select fields_ but I couldn't find more information about it. if you have any information about it and want to share, i would be very happy!
